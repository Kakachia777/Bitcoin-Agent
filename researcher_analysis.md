Key Contributions:
1. Introduced the Transformer model, which is based entirely on self-attention mechanisms and does not require recurrent or convolutional layers.
2. Introduced the self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words when encoding a word, enabling the capturing of long-range dependencies more effectively.
3. Enabled more parallelization during training by removing recurrence, speeding up the process and improving efficiency on modern hardware.
4. Achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the Transformer model.

Structure of the Paper:
1. Introduction: Discussion on the limitations of existing models and the motivation for the Transformer model.
2. Model Architecture: Detailed description of the Transformer architecture, including the encoder-decoder structure, multi-head self-attention, and position-wise feed-forward networks.
3. Self-Attention: Explanation of the self-attention mechanism and its computation.
4. Positional Encoding: Discussion on the addition of positional encodings to input embeddings to capture the order of words.
5. Training and Results: Description of the training process, datasets used, and the comparative results achieved by the Transformer model.
6. Conclusion: Summary of the findings and potential future directions for research.

Impact:
The Transformer model has had a profound impact on the field of NLP and beyond, becoming the foundation for many subsequent models, including BERT, GPT, and T5. This has led to significant improvements in various NLP tasks. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism has been successfully applied to other areas, such as computer vision.
